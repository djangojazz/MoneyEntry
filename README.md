MoneyEntry
==========

This is a private project for Money Entry based on the MVVM Model example listed off of MSDN Magazine in February 2009:

It is basically a glorified checkbook register and may have updates for SSRS or other charting in the future.  
The original project I created a while back based off of winforms and this is an updated method.

The focus of the project is mainly to synch with a database in real time as properties are changed and to work with multiple accounts simultaneously.
